# HASP - Open SwitchPlate Custom Component

This custom component simplifies synchronization of objects on one or more hasp-lvgl [HASP - Open SwitchPlates](https://haswitchplate.github.io/openHASP-docs/) with Home Assistant entities. An Open SwitchPlate is basically a small touchscreen device which you can mount on the wall in place of a switch, and you can design your custom user interface for it using json. You can build your own hardware but you can also buy them ready-made.
